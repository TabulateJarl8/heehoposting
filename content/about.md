![Hello! My name is Jackson (he/they)](/images/mirror-selfie.jpg)

I am a 23-year-old Computer Science major at James Madison University and a software developer who loves programming, gaming, and all things tech. I live in the beautiful state of Virginia with my parents and my lovely (and slightly overweight) cat, Tippy.

## Interests

You'll find references to these all over this website.

### Computers

It'd be strange for me to be a software developer and not like computers, right? Computers have been a part of my life ever since I was a kid (my first computer was a 2002 Apple eMac), and everything I'm interested in stems from that early exposure to technology.

Nowadays, I own and tinker with many computers. If you're curious, you can check some of them out on the [What I Use](/what-i-use/) page.

I also code a lot in my free time. If you want to see what I'm working on, visit the [Projects](/projects/) page.

### Video Games

My first handheld was a Nintendo DS that I got for my eighth birthday, and I've been into video games ever since. Here are some of my favorites:

- Obviously, the Shin Megami Tensei franchise
- Granblue Fantasy Versus Rising
- Baldur's Gate 3
- Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order
- Sid Meier's Civilization V
- Rollercoaster Tycoon 2

Lately, my main focus has been fighting games, especially after my trip to Frosty Faustings in January 2024. I'm currently playing Granblue Fantasy Versus Rising, but I'm eagerly waiting for 2XKO.

### Art

I spend a significant chunk of my free time drawing‚Äîmostly doodles and sketches of whatever I'm hyperfixating on. I'll get around to posting my art someday, but I'm not quite ready for that yet. I'm also interested in animation, though I haven't animated anything in over six years. It's something I want to get back into.

Who knows? Maybe something will end up on this website someday. üòâ

### Music

I love listening to music whenever I'm out and want to tune everything around me out. Noise-cancelling earbuds are incredible‚Äîhighly recommend them if you can afford a pair.

My music taste is all over the place, but here are some artists I keep coming back to:

- Porter Robinson
- The Smiths
- The 1975
- Caravan Palace
- Madeon
- Ado

I'm also a big fan of VOCALOID! My favorite songs right now are [Mesmerizer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19y8YTbvri8), [Desert Planet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn8Vs_kKQMc), and [Lagtrain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnIhRpIT7nc)!

### Tabletop Games

Wrapping up my collection of nerdy interests, we come to the one closest to my heart: tabletop games. I really got into Dungeons & Dragons in high school, with the Paladin class being my favorite (though I've heard they got seriously nerfed in One D&D, unfortunately üôÅ). I've also dabbled in the Cyberpunk TTRPG, and find its incredibly cool to interact with. Though my last campaign I was in got cut short, I'm eager to join another one soon.

I'm also a big fan of Magic the Gathering, with Commander being my main format. I also keep a cube of Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty around for when there's enough people to draft it. Magic is a topic that I could talk about endlessly, so it'll probably end up on the blog, too.

### Conclusion

I hope that this gives you some insight as to what makes me tick. My hobbies are very important to me, whether it's programming, gaming, or rolling dice and slinging spells. Thanks for stopping by! üëã
