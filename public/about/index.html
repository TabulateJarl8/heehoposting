    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p><figure>

</figure></p>
<p>I am a 23-year-old Computer Science major at James Madison University and a software developer who loves programming, gaming, and all things tech. I live in the beautiful state of Virginia with my parents and my lovely (and slightly overweight) cat, Tippy.</p>
<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>You&rsquo;ll find references to these all over this website.</p>
<h3>Computers</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;d be strange for me to be a software developer and not like computers, right? Computers have been a part of my life ever since I was a kid (my first computer was a 2002 Apple eMac), and everything I&rsquo;m interested in stems from that early exposure to technology.</p>
<p>Nowadays, I own and tinker with many computers. If you&rsquo;re curious, you can check some of them out on the <a href="/what-i-use/">What I Use</a> page.</p>
<p>I also code a lot in my free time. If you want to see what I&rsquo;m working on, visit the <a href="/projects/">Projects</a> page.</p>
<h3>Video Games</h3>
<p>My first handheld was a Nintendo DS that I got for my eighth birthday, and I&rsquo;ve been into video games ever since. Here are some of my favorites:</p>
<ul>
<li>Obviously, the Shin Megami Tensei franchise</li>
<li>Granblue Fantasy Versus Rising</li>
<li>Baldur&rsquo;s Gate 3</li>
<li>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</li>
<li>Sid Meier&rsquo;s Civilization V</li>
<li>Rollercoaster Tycoon 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Lately, my main focus has been fighting games, especially after my trip to Frosty Faustings in January 2024. I&rsquo;m currently playing Granblue Fantasy Versus Rising, but I&rsquo;m eagerly waiting for 2XKO.</p>
<h3>Art</h3>
<p>I spend a significant chunk of my free time drawing‚Äîmostly doodles and sketches of whatever I&rsquo;m hyperfixating on. I&rsquo;ll get around to posting my art someday, but I&rsquo;m not quite ready for that yet. I&rsquo;m also interested in animation, though I haven&rsquo;t animated anything in over six years. It&rsquo;s something I want to get back into.</p>
<p>Who knows? Maybe something will end up on this website someday. üòâ</p>
<h3>Music</h3>
<p>I love listening to music whenever I&rsquo;m out and want to tune everything around me out. Noise-cancelling earbuds are incredible‚Äîhighly recommend them if you can afford a pair.</p>
<p>My music taste is all over the place, but here are some artists I keep coming back to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Porter Robinson</li>
<li>The Smiths</li>
<li>The 1975</li>
<li>Caravan Palace</li>
<li>Madeon</li>
<li>Ado</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m also a big fan of VOCALOID! My favorite songs right now are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19y8YTbvri8">Mesmerizer</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn8Vs_kKQMc">Desert Planet</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnIhRpIT7nc">Lagtrain</a>!</p>
<h3>Tabletop Games</h3>
<p>Wrapping up my collection of nerdy interests, we come to the one closest to my heart: tabletop games. I really got into Dungeons &amp; Dragons in high school, with the Paladin class being my favorite (though I&rsquo;ve heard they got seriously nerfed in One D&amp;D, unfortunately üôÅ). I&rsquo;ve also dabbled in the Cyberpunk TTRPG, and find its incredibly cool to interact with. Though my last campaign I was in got cut short, I&rsquo;m eager to join another one soon.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also a big fan of Magic the Gathering, with Commander being my main format. I also keep a cube of Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty around for when there&rsquo;s enough people to draft it. Magic is a topic that I could talk about endlessly, so it&rsquo;ll probably end up on the blog, too.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I hope that this gives you some insight as to what makes me tick. My hobbies are very important to me, whether it&rsquo;s programming, gaming, or rolling dice and slinging spells. Thanks for stopping by! üëã</p>
