    <h1>My Tools of the Trade</h1>
    <p>I know no one asked, but I love to talk about technology and what I&rsquo;ve got. This is not meant as a definitive &ldquo;you should get these things&rdquo; list, but I mean&hellip; it couldn&rsquo;t hurt, right? ;)</p>
<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>
<h3 id="desktop">Desktop</h3>
<ul>
<li>CPU: Ryzen 9 5950x</li>
<li>Motherboard: MSI X570S Carbon MAX WiFi</li>
<li>RAM: 64GB of G.Skill Trident Z @ 3600 MHz</li>
<li>GPU: PowerColor Red Devil RX 6900XT</li>
<li>PSU: 1000W EVGA Gold</li>
</ul>
<p>This is my daily driver system that&rsquo;s meant for all of my gaming and programming needs. You may notice that these parts are all AMD, where is the Intel and NVIDIA stuff? Well, I deliberately made the choice to avoid NVIDIA because:</p>
<ol>
<li>Their drivers have historically not worked well with Linux and that&rsquo;s a non-negotiable for me. <small>(I have heard that the drivers are open source now, so who knows what the future holds&hellip;)</small></li>
<li>Their graphics cards were $200-$300 more expensive than their AMD counterparts when I was building this system (even <em>more</em> expensive now!!!) and I didn&rsquo;t feel that the upcharge was worth it (I don&rsquo;t care about ray-tracing).</li>
</ol>
<p>And I avoided Intel mainly because AMD was just cheaper at the time I was building this system, but I don&rsquo;t have any particular loyalty to either-or. Both of their chips work perfectly fine on Linux as far as I&rsquo;m aware.</p>
<p>I run Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC out of necessity and because I have an ISO with a license, but my daily driver operating system is Fedora Linux, which has been serving me well. Windows is only present to handle situations that Fedora can&rsquo;t (games with invasive anti-cheat and proprietary drivers). When Windows 10 LTSC goes EOL, I am probably jumping ship to Linux full time (finally).</p>
<h3 id="laptop">Laptop</h3>
<ul>
<li>Model: Framework 16</li>
<li>CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 7840HS</li>
<li>RAM: 32GB of Corsair DDR5 @ 5600 MHz</li>
<li>GPU: AMD Radeon RX 7700S</li>
</ul>
<p>Aah, the Framework 16. Probably the best laptop I have ever used (and will hopefully use for the next several years). This laptop has done basically everything I&rsquo;ve asked of it and it still gives me some wiggle room. If the time ever comes that this isn&rsquo;t enough, most things in this laptop are fully replaceable, so as long as Framework is still around when I need to upgrade this, I&rsquo;ll be set for a long long while.</p>
<p>I only run Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC on this laptop, however, because I only have one 2TB drive in it at the moment. If I buy another one, I&rsquo;ll do the same dual boot setup that I&rsquo;ve done with my main desktop.</p>
<p>This laptop has been my main workhorse when I&rsquo;m out travelling or just don&rsquo;t want to leave my bed that day. I have no complaints really, it does everything I want and more.</p>
