        <h1>My Tools of the Trade</h1>
        <p>
          I know no one asked, but I love to talk about technology and what
          I've got. This is not meant as a definitive "you should get these
          things" list, but I mean... it couldn't hurt, right? ;)
        </p>

        <h2>Hardware</h2>
        <h3>Desktop</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>CPU: Ryzen 9 5950x</li>
          <li>Motherboard: MSI X570S Carbon MAX WiFi</li>
          <li>RAM: 64GB of G.Skill Trident Z @ 3600 MHz</li>
          <li>GPU: PowerColor Red Devil RX 6900XT</li>
          <li>PSU: 1000W EVGA Gold</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This is my daily driver system that's meant for all of my gaming and
          programming needs. You may notice that these parts are all AMD,
          where is the Intel and NVIDIA stuff? Well, I deliberately made the
          choice to avoid NVIDIA because:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Their drivers have historically not worked well with Linux and
            that's a non-negotiable for me.
            <small>(I have heard that the drivers are open source now, so who
              knows what the future holds...)</small>
          </li>
          <li>
            Their graphics cards were $200-$300 more expensive than their AMD
            counterparts when I was building this system (even
            <em>more</em> expensive now!!!) and I didn't feel that the
            upcharge was worth it (I don't care about ray-tracing).
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          And I avoided Intel mainly because AMD was just cheaper at the time
          I was building this system, but I don't have any particular loyalty
          to either-or. Both of their chips work perfectly fine on Linux as
          far as I'm aware.
        </p>
        <p>
          I run Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC out of necessity and because I have
          an ISO with a license, but my daily driver operating
          system is Fedora Linux, which has been serving me well. Windows is
          only present to handle situations that Fedora can't (games with
          invasive anti-cheat and proprietary drivers). When Windows 10 LTSC
          goes EOL, I am probably jumping ship to Linux full time (finally).
        </p>
        <h3>Laptop</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Model: Framework 16</li>
          <li>CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 7840HS</li>
          <li>RAM: 32GB of Corsair DDR5 @ 5600 MHz</li>
          <li>GPU: AMD Radeon RX 7700S</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Aah, the Framework 16. Probably the best laptop I have ever used
          (and will hopefully use for the next several years). This laptop has
          done basically everything I've asked of it and it still gives me
          some wiggle room. If the time ever comes that this isn't enough,
          most things in this laptop are fully replaceable, so as long as
          Framework is still around when I need to upgrade this, I'll be set
          for a long long while.
        </p>
        <p>
          I only run Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC on this laptop, however,
          because I only have one 2TB drive in it at the moment. If I buy
          another one, I'll do the same dual boot setup that I've done with my
          main desktop.
        </p>
        <p>
          This laptop has been my main workhorse when I'm out travelling or
          just don't want to leave my bed that day. I have no complaints
          really, it does everything I want and more.
