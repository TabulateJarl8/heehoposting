# Heehoposting, my personal website!

Howdy! It's been a little bit since my first draft of Heehoposting went live in late 2021, and after a brief phase of overcomplicated design, I've finally realized that basic HTML, CSS, and JS is _probably_ enough for something like this. I can't wait to be proven wrong. ;)

Anyway, welcome to [Heehoposting 2.0](https://heehoposting.xyz)!

## New stuff:

- Uses Hugo as a static site generator, so that its simple and loads fast.
- Updated layout, retaining the original feel of the site while also being simpler.
- Blog section, which will hopefully have new stuff in it soon!
- and basically common sense stuff that the site should have had to begin with! Oops!

## License:

Man, I dunno. Do whatever you want, just don't pretend that its me doing it. I'm just yapping about myself on this website so I have zero idea why I'd need to elaborate on this.

## Plans:

Current plan is for me to use this website as my own little personal spot on the web, but the domain itself is going to get a ton of use. :)
